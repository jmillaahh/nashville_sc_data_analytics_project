# nsc_tech_analytics_data_project
Repository containing relevant code and write-up for first round data project for Nashville SC Technical Analytics internship role for Spring 2021

Run the `main.py` file

The following repository contains a .zip file with the relevant Metadata (.json) file and player + ball tracking (.jsonl) file. The .jsonl file was too large to upload to GH, so I've included it and the .json file in a compressed folder. In order to run the script that generates the desired .csv file, either extract the files out and into the same base folder (same folder where main.py lives) or copy the relevant files into the same base folder.

Please note that if you wish to use the same files that were provided to me, they must have the exact same filenames (if you use the default filename entering option). This will not be an issue if you decide to copy-paste the filenames exactly when prompted.

==================

I've included my write-up here as well as a video walkthrough to explain how to run the project and the required inputs. Additinally, I've elected to omit the inclusion of my final deliverable CSV file in this repo so that you can run the project and create it for yourself.
